 Assignment 1: CHECK 
 code works properly, but need to create branches for individual assignments for completion checks
 a check can be granted once proper branch is in place 
 be sure to follow appropriate input key mappings for future assignments 
 github will translate 'Assignment 1' into 'Assignment-1'. Please use 'Assignment-X' for branching of Assignment X
 branch lables are case sensitive
 comment: branch is now found properly
 
 Assignment 2: CHECK 
 good work
